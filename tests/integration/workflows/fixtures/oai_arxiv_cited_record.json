      "value": "The effects on the non-relativistic dynamics of a system compound by two electrons interacting by a Coulomb potential and with an external harmonic\r\noscillator potential, confined to move in a two dimensional Euclidean space, are investigated. In particular, it is shown that it is possible to determine\r\nexactly and in a closed form a finite portion of the energy spectrum and the associated eigeinfunctions for the Schr\\\"odinger equation describing the relative motion of the electrons, by putting it into the form of a biconfluent Heun equation. In the same framework, another set of solutions of this type can\r\nbe straightforwardly obtained for the case when the two electrons are submitted also to an external constant magnetic field."
