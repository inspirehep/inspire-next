INDEX ON JSONB TYPE FIELD


1. RECORDSMETADATA.JSON ids
===========================
The following SQL query adds an index to RecordMetadata.json field.
The index can then be used in queries like:

db.session.query(RecordMetadata.id)\
.filter(type_coerce(RecordMetadata.json, JSONB)['ids'].contains('[{"schema": "ORCID", "value": "0000-"}]')).one()

Which translates to:
SELECT records_metadata.id AS records_metadata_id
FROM records_metadata
WHERE ((records_metadata.json -> 'ids')) @> '[{"schema": "ORCID", "value": "0000-"}]';


Note: this query assumes that RecordMetadata.json field requires to
be coerced to JSONB type as it wasn'e defined properly in the model.

We are about to do this operation manually because our Alembic migrations
are currently broken and we have the urge of creating this index.

Note: this index and this file will be removed when we solved the
problem with our Alembic migration and replaced by a proper
migration. See: https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/INSPIR-375


-- CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY json_ids_index ON records_metadata USING gin ((json -> 'ids'));

-- DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY json_ids_index;


2. RECORDSMETADATA.JSON _export_to
==================================
The following SQL query adds an index to RecordMetadata.json field.
The index can then be used in queries like:

RecordMetadata.query.filter(type_coerce(RecordMetadata.json, JSONB)['_export_to'].contains('[{"HAL": true}]')

Which translates to:

SELECT *
FROM records_metadata
WHERE (records_metadata.json -> '_export_to') @> '[{"HAL": true}]';


-- CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY json_export_to_index ON records_metadata USING gin ((json -> '_export_to'));

-- DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY json_export_to_index;


3. NOTE
=======
In order to test indexes in a small db (eg. dev machine) you might need to disable the sequential scan:
-- SET enable_seqscan = OFF;
