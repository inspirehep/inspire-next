INDEX ON JSONB TYPE FIELD

The following SQL query adds an index to RecordMetadata.json field.
The index can then be used in queries like:

db.session.query(RecordMetadata.id)\
.filter(type_coerce(RecordMetadata.json, JSONB)['ids'].contains(orcid_object)).one()

Note: this query assumes that RecordMetadata.json field requires to
be coerced to JSONB type as it wasn'e defined properly in the model.

We are about to do this operation manually because our Alembic migrations
are currently broken and we have the urge of creating this index.

Note: this index and this file will be removed when we solved the
problem with our Alembic migration and replaced by a proper
migration. See: https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/INSPIR-375


-- CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY json_ids_index ON records_metadata USING gin ((json -> 'ids'));

-- DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY json_ids_index;
