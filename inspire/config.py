INSPIRE configuration
--------------------
Instance independent configuration (e.g. which extensions to load) is defined
in ``inspire.config'' while instance dependent configuration (e.g. database
host etc.) is defined in an optional ``inspire.instance_config'' which
can be installed by a separate package.

This config module is loaded by the Flask application factory via an entry
point specified in the setup.py::

    entry_points={
        'invenio.config': [
            "inspire = inspire.config"
        ]
    },
