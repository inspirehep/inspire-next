=====================
Current MARCXML usage
=====================

This directory contains 2 types of files:
 * The repeatable ones contain information about which field (and subfields
   within fields) are repeated for a given collection. The number in parenthesis
   can be used as a hint to know which entries are actually outliers that need
   to be corrected.
 * The other type of files list for every MARC field/subfield some statistics
   and example of values (and in case, outliers).
