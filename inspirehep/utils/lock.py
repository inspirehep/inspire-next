    This lock is implemented through Redis in order to be globally visible.

    Args:
        lock_name (str): name of the lock to be acquired.
        expire (int): duration in seconds after which the lock is released if
            not renewed in the meantime.
        auto_renewal (bool): if ``True``, the lock is automatically renewed as long
            as the context manager is still active.
        blocking (bool): if ``True``, wait for the lock to be released. If ``False``,
            return immediately, raising :class:`DistributedLockError`.

    It is recommended to set ``expire`` to a small value and
    ``auto_renewal=True``, which ensures the lock gets released quickly in case
    the process is killed without limiting the time that can be spent holding
    the lock.

    Raises:
        DistributedLockError: when ``blocking`` is set to ``False`` and the lock is already acquired.
