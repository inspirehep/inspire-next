    The workflow.files property it's actually a method that returns a

    it's parent FilesIterator. That method will end up calling `save` on a
    `invenio_files_rest.storage.pyfs.PyFSFileStorage` instance (through
    ObjectVersion and FileObject) that consumes the stream passed to it and
    saves on it's place a FileObject with the details of the downloaded file.
    Even if this looks simple and incorrect, it's quite complex and correct :/
