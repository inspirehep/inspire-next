About
=====

INSPIRE is the leading information platform for High Energy Physics (HEP) literature.
It provides users with high quality, curated metadata covering the entire corpus of
HEP and the fulltext of all such articles that are Open Access.

This repository contains the source code of the next version of INSPIRE, which is
currently under development, but already available at `<https://labs.inspirehep.net>`_.
It is based on version 3 of the `Invenio Digital Library Framework`_.

A preliminary version of the documentation is available on `Read the Docs`_.
