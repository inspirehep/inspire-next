Via Docker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Setup the test environment in ``docker``. If you have not installed ``docker`` and ``docker-compose``, please install them (`Docker install guide`__)

.. _install_docker: https://github.com/inspirehep/inspire-next/pull/1015
__ install_docker_

2. Go in the root directory of inspire project and run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

  docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml run --rm acceptance


Via Local Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Select the virtualenv of your INSPIRE project:

.. code-block:: bash

  workon name_of_your_inspire_virtual_env

2. Go into the root directory of INSPIRE project:

.. code-block:: bash

  (inspirehep)$ cdvirtualenv src/inspirehep/

3. Run all the services with ``honcho``:

.. code-block:: bash

  (inspirehep)$ honcho start

4. Install Firefox

5. Open a new console and inside the same directory run the tests:

.. code-block:: bash

  (inspirehep)$ SERVER_NAME="http://localhost:5000" py.test --driver Firefox --html=selenium-report.html tests/acceptance
