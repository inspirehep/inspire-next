Docker (Linux)
==============

Docker is an application that makes it simple and easy to run processes in a container,
which are like virtual machines, but more resource-friendly. For a detailed introduction to the
different components of a Docker container. For a detailed introduction to the different components
of a Docker container, you can follow `this tutorial
<https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/the-docker-ecosystem-an-introduction-to-common-components>`_.


Inspire and Docker
##################

Get the latest Docker appropriate to your operationg system, by visiting `Docker's official web site <https://www.docker.com/>`_ and accessing the
*Get Docker* section.

.. note:: If you are using Mac, please build a simple box with ``docker-engine`` above ``1.10`` and
         ``docker-compose`` above ``1.6.0``.

Make sure you can run docker without ``sudo``.

- ``id $USER``

  If you are not in the ``docker`` group, run the following command and then restart ``docker``. If this doesn't work, just restart your machine :)

- ``newgrp docker`` or ``su - $USER``

- ``sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER``

Get the latest `docker-compose
<https://docs.docker.com/compose/>`_:

.. code-block:: console

   $ sudo pip install docker-compose

- Add ``DOCKER_DATA`` env variable in your ``.bashrc`` or ``.zshrc``. In this directory you will have all the persistent data between Docker runs.

.. code-block:: console

   $ export DOCKER_DATA=~/inspirehep_docker_data/
   $ mkdir -p "$DOCKER_DATA"

By default the virtualenv and everything else will be kept on ``/tmp`` and they will be available only until the next reboot.

- Install a host persistent venv and build assets

.. Note::

 From now on all the docker-compose commands must be run at the root of the
 inspire-next repository, you can get a local copy with:

.. code-block:: console

   $ git clone git://github.com/inspirehep/inspire-next
   $ cd inspire-next

.. code-block:: console

   $ docker-compose pull
   $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.deps.yml run --rm pip

.. note:: If you have trouble with internet connection inside docker probably you are facing known
          DNS issue. Please follow `this solution
          <http://askubuntu.com/questions/475764/docker-io-dns-doesnt-work-its-trying-to-use-8-8-8-8/790778#790778>`_
          with DNS: ``--dns 137.138.17.5 --dns 137.138.16.5``.

.. code-block:: console

   $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.deps.yml run --rm assets

- Run the service locally

.. code-block:: console

   $ docker-compose up

- Populate database

.. code-block:: console

   $ docker-compose run --rm web scripts/recreate_records


Once you have the database populated with the tables and demo records, you can
go to `localhost:5000 <http://localhost:5000>`_


- Run tests in an **isolated** environment.


.. Note::

 The tests use a different set of containers than the default ``docker-compose
 up``, so if you run both at the same time you might start having ram/load
 issues, if so, you can stop all the containers started by ``docker-compose
 up`` with ``docker-compose kill -f``

You can choose one of the following tests types:

  - unit
  - workflows
  - integration
  - acceptance-authors
  - acceptance-literature

.. code-block:: console

   $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml run --rm <tests type>
   $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml down

.. tip:: - cleanup all the containers:

           ``docker rm $(docker ps -qa)``

         - cleanup all the images:

           ``docker rmi $(docker images -q)``

         - cleanup the virtualenv (careful, if docker_data is set to something you care about, it will be removed):

           ``sudo rm -rf "${DOCKER_DATA?DOCKER_DATA was not set, ignoring}"``

Extra useful tips
#################

- Run a random shell

.. code-block:: console

   $ docker-compose run --rm web inspirehep shell

- Run *virtualenv* bash shell for running scripts manually (e.g. recreating records or `building documentation`_)

.. _building documentation: http://inspirehep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/building_the_docs.html

.. code-block:: console

   $ docker-compose run --rm web bash

- Reload code in a worker

.. code-block:: console

   $ docker-compose restart worker

- Quick and safe reindex

.. code-block:: console

   $ docker-compose restart worker && docker-compose run --rm web scripts/recreate_records

- Recreate all static assets. Will download all dependencies from npm and copy all static
  files to ``${DOCKER_DATA}/tmp/virtualenv/var/inspirehep-instance/static``.

.. code-block:: console

   $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.deps.yml run --rm assets

- Monitor the output from all the services (elasticsearch, web, celery workers, database, flower, rabbitmq, scrapyd, redis)
  via the following command:

.. code-block:: console

   $ docker-compose up
