INVENIO
#######

`Invenio
<https://invenio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ is a free software suite enabling you to run your own digital library or document repository
on the web. The technology offered by the software covers all aspects of digital library management,
from document ingestion through classification, indexing, and curation up to document dissemination.
Invenio complies with standards such as the Open Archives Initiative and uses MARC 21 as its
underlying bibliographic format. The flexibility and performance of Invenio make it a comprehensive
solution for management of document repositories of moderate to large sizes.

Invenio has been originally developed at CERN to run the CERN document server, managing over
1,000,000 bibliographic records in high-energy physics since 2002, covering articles, books, journals,
photos, videos, and more. Invenio is nowadays co-developed by an international collaboration
comprising institutes such as CERN, DESY, EPFL, FNAL, SLAC and is being used by many more scientific
institutions worldwide.

INSPIRE is build on top of latest Invenio currently version is 3.0.


For a detailed description of how we use the different Invenio modules, see
