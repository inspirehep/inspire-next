Workflows in Inspire
--------------------

Inspire-next is receiving new records every day from several sources, such as:
    * HEP Crawl
    * Legacy
    * Literature Suggest

It's very important for the Inpire to import valid and pure records. So, it's mandatory to process
every record that is coming to us. Workflows does that important procedure.

At the bellow diagram you can have a very basic idea of what is the structure of that procedure.
