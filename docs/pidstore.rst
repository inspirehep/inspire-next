2.2.1 Pidstore in Inspire-next
------------------------------

Pidstore is based on an `Invenio module
<https://invenio-pidstore.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ that mints,
stores, registers and resolves persistent identifiers. More over pidstore has several uses in Inspire-next:

- Map record ids (UUIDs) between ElasticSearch and DataBase. In that way every record, that is stored
  in the Database, can be fetched and imported by ElasticSearch. Also, it's important to report that
  the records for the front-end are inherited by ``ES Record``, so they are coming from ElasticSearch.

- Pidstore also provide a unique identifier for every record that is the *known* id for the outer world.

In the following you can find how pidstore is connected with Inspire-next.

2.2.2 Pidstore and Database
---------------------------

In this part there is presented a diagram describing the basic relations between Pidstore tables and
Database record.
There are three basic tables:

- Record Metadata: is the table of the actual record stored in the database. The primary key (id) is
  foreign key (object_uuid) for the table ``Pidstore Pid``. In that way record is mapped to the pidstore.

- Pidstore Pid: is the main table of pidstore in which are stored all the *known* ids called ``pid_value``
  for the outer world. For example given url of a specific record ``https://server_name.cern.ch/literature/1482866`` ,
  number ``1482866`` is the ``pid_value`` stored in ``Pidstore Pid`` table.

- Pidstore Redirect: is the table of pidstore that keeps the mapping of a record that is redirected
  to another record.
