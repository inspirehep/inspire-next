About
=====

Inspire is a set of services, the main one being a search engine for high energy physics papers,
with some side services like authors profiles, conferences, journals, institutions, experiments and
a small specialized job market. It's main purpose is to provide physicists worldwide with a source
of information about high energy physics related topics.

Currently we have two main websites open to the public:

* The `Legacy website
  <http://inspirehep.net/>`_, with the current production application.

* The `QA website
  <https://qa.inspirehep.net/>`_, running the latest inspire-next code (for test purposes only).
